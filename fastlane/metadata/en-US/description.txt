The label of the alcohol is automatically read !! It means that you can later search for words in labels, without any manual input. All that you need to do is to rate it !

Why this app

LESS TYPING

By automatic label reading, all that you need to do in order to logging the alcohol is only to pick a photo, and rate it by stars. You can also comment to it, if you want. You do NOT need to enter the name or detail attributes of alcohol. Those are read automatically, and you can search for them later .

NO MORE SIGN UP
